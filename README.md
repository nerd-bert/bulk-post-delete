# bulk-post-delete

Hey there. This is a wordpress plugin to Bulk deletion of all posts within a certain time period.

Be careful when using this plugin! It deletes all published posts in a period of time.

Select the date before the date of the posts to be deleted as the start date. The end date is the date after the date of the posts to be deleted.
So if you want to delete articles in the period from the 15th of October to the 20th of October, select the 14th as the start date and the 21st as the end date.
You can also delete the posts featured image linked to the post from the media library at the same time if the checkbox is activated.

ATTENTION: This step is not reversible! The posts are not transferred to the recycle bin but deleted completely. This also applies to the posts featured image, if the checkbox is selected!

Use at your own risk. Have fun, yours, Nerd Bert

BTW: There is no and will not be a PRO Version of this plugin. But if you like what I am doing, please buy me a coffee (https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=6PRSHVD6GCG6Q)
